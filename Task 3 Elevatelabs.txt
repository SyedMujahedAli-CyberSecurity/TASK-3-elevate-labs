Task 3 — Basic Vulnerability Scan on Local Machine
Name: Syed Mujahed Ali
Internship:  Elevate labs Cybersecurity Internship — Task 3
Tools: Nessus Essentials
Target: Windows 11 (192.168.0.102)


* Objective: 
Perform a basic vulnerability assessment of my local Windows 11 machine using Nessus Essentials to identify misconfigurations and common vulnerabilities. Document the most critical findings, their severity, and simple mitigations.


* Tools:
- Nessus Essentials (version: [show version if available])
- Windows 11 (Host: 192.168.0.102)
- Browser: Firefox/Chrome for Nessus UI
- IP discovery: ipconfig (Windows)


*  Setup & Scan Configuration
I installed Nessus Essentials, registered with a free activation key, and created a Basic Network Scan. The scan target was my local IP 192.168.0.102. A default plugin set was used.
* Vulnerability Review & Severity Analysis
The Nessus Essentials scan on the local machine (192.168.0.102, Windows 11) identified 26 vulnerabilities.
Severity Summary
* Critical: 0

* High: 0

* Medium: 2

* Low: 0

* Info: 24

Medium Severity Vulnerabilities
1. SMB Signing Not Required
   * Plugin ID: 57608

   * CVSS v3.0 Base Score: 5.3

   * Description: SMB signing is disabled, allowing potential Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks on SMB traffic.



      * Mitigation:

         * Enable SMB signing in Windows by going to Local Group Policy Editor → Computer Configuration → Windows Settings → Security Settings → Local Policies → Security Options → Enable Microsoft network server: Digitally sign communications (always).
2. SSL Certificate Cannot Be Trusted
         * Plugin ID: 51192

         * CVSS v3.0 Base Score: 6.5

         * Description: The SSL certificate presented is either self-signed, issued by an unknown authority, expired, or mismatched, breaking the chain of trust.

         * Mitigation:

            * Purchase or generate a valid SSL certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

            * Install the certificate properly on the server and ensure intermediate CA certificates are included in the chain. 


               * Informational Findings & Simple Mitigation
               1. SSL/TLS Multiple Issues – Update SSL/TLS configuration to only allow strong protocols (e.g., TLS 1.2/1.3) and disable weak ciphers.

               2. HTTP Information Leakage – Disable unnecessary HTTP headers and enable secure headers like Strict-Transport-Security.

               3. Open Ports (SSH, DCE Services, Netstat) – Restrict access to only trusted IP addresses via firewall rules.

               4. Service Detection (Splunk, Windows Services) – Disable unused services to reduce attack surface.



                  * No Critical Vulnerabilities Found
